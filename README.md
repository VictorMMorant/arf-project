# arf-project
ARF Project. This repository contains an implementation of a CNN for Message Polarity Classification in Twitter. It is based on TensorFlow Framework.
# Todo List

- Extend evaluation metrics from accuracy to precision, recall and F1
- Try pre-trained embeddings such as GloVe or word2vec and compare it with the embedding generated from the training partition.
- Suggest a new CNN model and compare the performance with the one from Yoon Kim
- Add TensorFlow Summaries to the training script.
- Experiment with the optimizers( encharged to compute the gradient of the network) provided by Tensor Flow
